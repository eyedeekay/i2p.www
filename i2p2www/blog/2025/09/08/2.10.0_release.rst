Work continues on the implementation and deployment of post-quantum cryptography in I2P.
In this release post-quantum cryptography is available but not turned on by default for new tunnels.
Those of you interested in testing post-quantum support should enable it via the "Hidden Service Manager" under "Encryption Types."
Be sure to get in touch on #i2p-dev in IRC2P for help and to report any issues you encounter.

I2PSnark now supports UDP trackers.
This should help the network overall by reducing the load of torrent trackers.

Stability improvements have been made to the Hidden Mode which will reduce the chance of running out of RouterInfos.

Important! In the next release, I2P will require Java 17 or later.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release.
The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
