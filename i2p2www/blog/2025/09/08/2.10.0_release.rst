{% trans -%}
Work continues on the implementation and deployment of post-quantum cryptography in I2P.
In this release post-quantum cryptography is available but not turned on by default for new tunnels.
Those of you interested in testing post-quantum support should enable it via the "Hidden Service Manager" under "Encryption Types."
Be sure to get in touch on #i2p-dev in IRC2P for help and to report any issues you encounter.

{% trans -%}
I2PSnark now supports UDP trackers.
This should help the network overall by reducing the load of torrent trackers.

{% trans -%}
Stability improvements have been made to the Hidden Mode which will reduce the chance of running out of RouterInfos.
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
Important! In the next release, I2P will require Java 17 or later.
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
As usual, we recommend that you update to this release.
The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
