{% trans -%}
Thread usage has been improved to improve the performance of the i2ptunnel system.
NTCP2 has been improved to resist probing attacks.
The notification system has been integrated into more applications to provide better feedback to users from I2PSnark and the other applications.
Automatic floodfill enrollment has been fixed.
Users may observe increased resource usage when acting as floodfill.
If this is not desired, floodfill mode can be disabled on the /config page.

A new global map feature is available in the console which shows the locations of routers in your view of the netDb.
These are the peers that help your router build tunnels and provide services anonymously.

Work continues on implementing automatic bandwidth management for tunnels, the Datagram2 protocol, and Post-Quantum cryptography.
In two releases, at 2.11.0, I2P will require Java 17.
