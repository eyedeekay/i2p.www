<h1>{{ _('I2P Easy Install Bundle (Beta) for Windows') }}</h1>
<p>{% trans firefox="/firefox" -%}
This is an "All-in-One" installer for Windows 10 which includes the complete I2P
desktop software and all of its dependencies in a single, easy-to-install
package. It is built on the premise that I2P should be easy, and that we should
help our users get their initial configuration in place instead of requiring an
elaborate install process. To learn more about the Firefox profile that
comes bundled with this installer, visit <a href="{{ firefox }}">The Firefox
Profile Page</a>.

<p>{% trans -%}
The latest I2P Easy-Install bundle for Windows has been released unsigned.
Please verify that the hashes match the downloads when installing the bundle.

<h2>{{ _('What do I need to use it?') }}</h2>
<p><strong>{% trans -%}
Just Firefox (Or Tor Browser).{%- endtrans %}</strong>
{% trans issueurl="https://i2pgit.org/I2P_Developers/i2p.firefox/-/issues/2" -%}
This installer still requires Firefox to be installed on the system, it does not
bundle a Firefox installer of its own. Please obtain Firefox from Mozilla, or
Tor Browser from the Tor Project or one of their mirrors. If you would like to
discuss supporting other browsers, please join the discussionon the
<a href="{{ issueurl }}">Gitlab Issue</a>. This is a Windows-only
product.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<h2>{{ _('Why should I use it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
This installer package reduces the number of steps required to install an I2P
router on Windows from about 30 to a matter of completing a single, familiar
installer process, combining the I2P installation and Browser configuration into
the same steps. Besides that, it launches the user directly into the
automatically configured I2P browser with their applications ready-to-use, with
no need to refer to potentially unhelpful system-wide Windows settings. The I2P
it uses is otherwise identical to the "regular" I2P.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<h2>{{ _('How do I use it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans firefox="https://www.mozilla.org/" -%}
First, download and install <a href="{{ firefox }}">Firefox</a>, then,
just download and install this installer(below). To
start an installer, "double-click" the downloaded .exe file.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
Running the installer will create a shortcut to start browsing I2P in your start
menu and on your desktop. Clicking this shortcut will start I2P if necessary,
then start an I2P Browser. On the first run, you will also be promted with the
bandwidth wizard in your browser window. You will also see a "Toopie" icon in
your taskbar to indicate that I2P is working when the browser window is closed.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P Browsing uses a separate, I2P-Only Firefox
profile, so it won't interfere with your regular Firefox use or require any
special configuration. You don't even need to close existing Firefox windows.

<p><strong>{% trans -%}
A Jpackaged I2P Router: {%- endtrans %}</strong>
{% trans -%}The I2P router is "jpackaged" which means that it includes all
the required Java components it needs to run successfully. It does not require
a separate Java installation, because it bundles a Java Runtime which is only
used for I2P.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p><strong>{% trans -%}
Browser Extensions: {%- endtrans %}</strong>
{% trans -%}The browser profile also includes both the NoScript and HTTPSEverywhere plugin for
better protection Javascript based attacks and HTTPS support where available. It
also keeps your I2P search activity separate from your visible internet search
activity. The profile configures the I2P Proxy for all sites and browser features.
I2P In Private Browsing is used to provide I2P-Specific browser integrations.

<h2>{{ _('How is it different from Tor Browser?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
This is not a fork of Firefox. Instead, it is a browser profile with pre-configured
settings, combined with an I2P router and some launcher scripts. That means that
it requires Firefox(Or Tor Browser) to be installed before you can use it. This
is for security reasons, it is important that you are able to recieve reliable
updates from a trustworthy vendor.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P routers are designed to have long uptimes, and so unlike Tor Browser, the
lifetime of your I2P Router is not tied to the lifetime of your I2P browsing
session. The browser profile will manage your history, your browser's local
storage and cache, and your browsing context but it will never stop your I2P
router on its own. You may stop the router using the web interface on the
router console homepage.
